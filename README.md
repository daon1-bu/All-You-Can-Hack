Pentest Python Tools

Collection of Python tools I am building while learning cybersecurity and penetration testing.

This repository documents my journey from networking fundamentals → Active Directory → offensive security.

Goals of this repo

Build small real tools to understand how pentesting tools work internally instead of only using automated frameworks.

Everything here is educational and lab use only.
